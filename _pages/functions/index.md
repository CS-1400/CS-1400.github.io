## Description
A function is a prewritten block of code with a name. A function is invoked by calling its name. Functions are used to eliminate repition in code. They optionally include/require:
  - **arguments**: the function's input; data given to the function enclosed within the parenthesis.
  - **return**: the function's output; data passed back to the line of code that called it.

## Types
1. Built-in Functions: These functions come pre-installed with Python. Common examples are `print()`, `input()`, `length()`, etc.  
2. User-defined functions: These are custom functions defined by a programmer. After the programmer defines a custom function, the function can be invoked by its name.
3. Imported functions: These functions are written in a module (aka python file) other than the file you are creating. You can import that module into your python file with an `import` statement.
