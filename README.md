# Python3 Reference Website
> I created this website as a reference for my students as they complete their programming assignments.

## Features
- [Website](https://cs-1400.github.io/) automatically redeploys with every push to a page in the _pages directory.
- More pages can be added to the website by creating another page in the _pages directory.
  - Use an existing page as a template.
