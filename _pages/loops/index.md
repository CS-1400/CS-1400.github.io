## Description
Loops are a control structure. They direct the order of execution of program statements. Loops allow programmers to repeat a block of code several times. The Python language includes two types of loops, each used for specific purposes:
- `while` loops (*indefinite iteration*): Loop body will continue executing until a condition fails.
- `for` loops (*finite iteration*):  Loop body will execute a specified number of times, or for each item of a container (ex: string). 

## Python Control Structures:
Loops are one of three program control structures. These control structures dictate the order in which a program's code executes:
- **Sequential**: Code is executed linearly, one after the other.
- **Selection**: Different block(s) of code are executed based on the results of a condition.
- **Iteration**: Repeating a block of code several times.
