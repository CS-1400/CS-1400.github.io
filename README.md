# CS-1400 Reference Website
> I created this website as a reference for my students as they complete their programming assignments.

## Features
- Website automatically redeploys with every push to a page in the _pages directory.
- More pages can be added to the website by creating another page in the _pages directory.
  - Use an existing page as a template.
- Automatically syncs with its parent repo (CS-1030/CS-1030.github.io) every Thursday night at 11pm UTC
  - The frequency and exact timing can be adjusted [here](https://github.com/CS-1400/CS-1400.github.io/blob/e3801251b0c36a5188c5e4eec6d3db3e329eef69/.github/workflows/fork-news.yml#L6)
  - The autosync will not delete any additions or edits made to this fork, it will simply produce a pull request to be for review.
