# CS-1400 with Ruiz
{: .fs-9 }

Welcome Students!
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---
 
I created this site as a reference for my students as they complete their programming assignments. It is not an exhaustive Python tutorial, nor is it a replacement for our approved textbook.

### Navigation
- In the main menu, you'll find programming topics organized into sections. 
- In the top menu, you can use the search bar to find specific information.

### Programming Feedback
I have created and deployed two "code bots" that live in our assignment repositories on GitHub. Each time you submit (commit) your program, They both scan it for any possible errors. They will comment their observations and suggestions in the **Pull Request** tab, under the **Feedback** conversation. I hope their instant and actionable feedback helps every one of my students with the most difficult part of programming: *debugging*.

### Python Links
