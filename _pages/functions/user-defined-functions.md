## Description
User-defined functions are custom functions defined by a programmer. After they are defined, they can be executed by calling their name. Functions are not executed when they are defined.

## Composition
{% highlight Python %}
def function_name(parameter1, parameter2):
    # function code indented under definition
    # more function code
    # even more function code

function_name(argument1, argument2)
{% endhighlight %}
