# CS-1400 Reference Website
> I created this website as a reference for my students as they complete their programming assignments.

## Want to contribute? Have an idea?
- I am 100% open to ideas, requests, fixes, and code contributions. [Here's how](https://github.com/CS-1400/CS-1400.github.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

## Features
- Website automatically redeploys with every new commit.
- More pages can be added to the website by creating another page in the _pages directory.
  - Use an existing page as a template.
  - If you'd like more customization, here's the [theme guide](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/)
- Interactive code snippets are embedded html via [repl.it](https://repl.it/~). 
- Automatically syncs with its parent repo ([CS-1030](https://github.com/CS-1030/CS-1030.github.io)) every Thursday night at 11pm UTC
  - The frequency and exact timing can be adjusted [here](https://github.com/CS-1400/CS-1400.github.io/blob/e3801251b0c36a5188c5e4eec6d3db3e329eef69/.github/workflows/fork-news.yml#L6)
  - The autosync will not delete any additions or edits made to this fork, it will simply produce a pull request for review.
  - The sync can also be run manually. Open the **Actions** tab, click **Fork News**, then click **Run workflow**.
- If **you fork this repo** instead of cloning it, you will also have access to all the upstream syncing goodness! [Follow these directions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/fork-news) in your own fork to set this up. This will automatically set up a scheduled pull request for you to approve.
