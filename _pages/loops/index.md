## Description
Loops allow programmers to repeat a block of code several times. The Python language includes two types of loops, each used for specific purposes:
- `while` loops: Loop body will continue executing until a condition fails.
- `for` loops:  Loop body will execute a specified number of times, or for each item of a container (like characters in a string). 

## Looping Techniques
Python docs has outlined many useful patterns to use when looping over sequences and dictionairies: [Looping Techniques](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#looping-techniques)

## Python Control Structures
Loops are one of three program control structures. These control structures dictate the order in which a program's code executes:
- **Sequential**: Code is executed linearly, one after the other.
- [**Selection**](../conditionals/): Different block(s) of code are executed based on the results of a condition.
- **Iteration**: Repeating a block of code several times.
